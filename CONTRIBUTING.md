# Contributing
Given that this project is effectively just a list of app IDs and their corresponding web domains, it's something I can't possibly complete on my own. I've tried to include a lot of common apps, but I'm certain I've missed some because it was based on the apps I use, and I don't use every app.

Therefore, contributions are welcome! You can help out in the following ways.

## Making a Pull Request
If you're comfortable with making a pull request, feel free to do so. The only thing I ask is that you preserve the alphabetical order in `db.txt`.

## Opening an Issue
If you're not comfortable with editing the file yourself, feel free to [open an issue](/issues/new/choose) if you have an app or apps you'd like to see added.

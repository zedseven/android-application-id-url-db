# Contributing
Given that this project is effectively just a list of app IDs and their corresponding web domains, it's something I can't possibly complete on my own. I've tried to include a lot of common apps, but I'm certain I've missed some because it was based on the apps I use, and I don't use every app.

Therefore, contributions are welcome! You can help out in the following ways.

## Making a Pull Request
If you're comfortable with making a pull request, feel free to do so. The only thing I ask is that you preserve the alphabetical order in `db.txt`.

## Opening an Issue
If you're not comfortable with editing the file yourself, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/zedseven/android-application-id-url-db/issues/new/choose) if you have an app or apps you'd like to see added.

# Finding the App ID of an App You Want to Add
The easiest way to do so is either by using an app like [Stanley](https://github.com/xgouchet/Stanley) or by finding your app's Play Store link.

If you look at a Play Store URL, you'll find that the app ID is right there after the `?id=` part:

### [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=*com.google.android.youtube*&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&hl=en_US)

So in this case, the ID we've found is `com.google.android.youtube`. (the ID only goes until the `&` in the link)

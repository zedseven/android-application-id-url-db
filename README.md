A simple list matching Android application IDs to associated websites - from my own experience and usage, so not an exhaustive list by any means.

I made this for [AppIdLinker](https://github.com/zedseven/AppIdLinker), a KeePass plugin that adds associated Android app IDs to password entries so they can be found more easily.
